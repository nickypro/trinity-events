Metafizz talks rather, by Erwin Schrodinger, A. C. Grayling, J.L. Austin, Alenka Zupančič, Jacqueline Rose, and Raymond Geuss, and what’s more, the Metafizz listens. Weekly you’ll find the society muttering to itself as a book club; talking of the Frankfurt School, Situationists, Deleuze, the Classics, What It Had For Lunch, and So On. Having its own library, which any member can access for business or pleasure, helps the conversation. Films are also screened by the society, because you know what they say about talking pictures.
